(* The [lsem c] relation defines the semantics of a linear command c
as the reflexive transitive closure of the [lsem1 c] relation that
describes the execution of the first instruction.

Therefore, [lsem c s] represents all states reachable from [s] by partial executions of [c].
A maximal execution (i.e., terminated without error) is caracterized by the fact that
the reached state has no instruction left to execute.
